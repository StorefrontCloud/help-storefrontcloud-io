# Access to API

Access to API is limited by Basic Auth or by pair X-Api-Key and X-User-Id headers.

## Authorization using Basic Auth
If you don't have your own Basic Auth credentials please contact us.

## Authorization using headers
You can check the value for headers in your Profile Page in our [Dashboard](https://dashboard.storefrontcloud.io/#/profile). The field "Your User ID" represents the `X-User-Id` header and the field "Your API Key" represents the `X-Api-Key` header.
