# Welcome

**Storefront Cloud** is a **Kubernetes** and **Git** based hosting service for [Vue Storefront](http://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront).

We've got a good news for You: This is the right place for getting all required information to start using the Cloud and move Your eCommerce to the next level!

## Register

In order to use the tools described in these docs please go to <a href="https://storefrontcloud.io">Storefront Cloud</a> and register Your account.

In the next step the Cloud Team will contact You to finalize the order + payment. After all the formal requirements fulfilled Your Cloud instance will be started and all necessary information will be passed to You in order to start using the service.

By default all customers are getting two public instances:

- **https://instance-name.storefrontcloud.io**
- **https://instance-name.test.storefrontcloud.io**

... plus Two Git repositories - one for [Frontend app](http://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront) and second for [API app](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront-api).

All the code is deployed using the **zero-downtime** scheme.

To access Your environment You'll get the following information:

- **kubectl.config** file including all the certificates required for this tool to connect to Your instance via [Storefront Cloud CLI tool](https://code.storefrontcloud.io/StorefrontCloud/storefrontcloud-cli),
- **login + password** to [Storefront Cloud Code Access Site](https://code.storefrontcloud.io) - Your Gitlab instance where You can manage the instances.
