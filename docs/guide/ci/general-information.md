# General Information

Storefront Cloud is using [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/README.html) as a base. Our users have full access to `.gitlab-ci.yml` file and they can modify it as they need. More information about `.gitlab-ci.yml` you can find in [GitLab CI documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html). All projects have access to shared runners deployed on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster which are managed by [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/).
